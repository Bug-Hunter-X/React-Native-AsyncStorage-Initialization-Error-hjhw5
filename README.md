# React Native AsyncStorage Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native applications. The error occurs when attempting to access AsyncStorage before it's fully initialized, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or app crashes.

## Problem

The problem arises from accessing AsyncStorage methods (like `getItem`, `setItem`, etc.) within lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount` before AsyncStorage is ready.  This asynchronous operation might not have completed by the time the access is attempted. 

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring AsyncStorage is ready before interacting with it.  This can be achieved using `setTimeout` to delay access or by ensuring the access happens after the component has fully mounted and any necessary initialization has occurred. The solution file provides a corrected approach.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the app using a React Native environment (e.g., Expo).
4. Observe the error behavior in the `bug.js` file.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution.
