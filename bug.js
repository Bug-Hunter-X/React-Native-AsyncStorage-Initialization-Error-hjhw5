This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native. The issue arises when you try to access AsyncStorage before it has been properly initialized, often leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  For example, if you try to read an item from AsyncStorage within the componentDidMount lifecycle method before AsyncStorage is ready, the app might crash or return unexpected data.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
componentDidMount() {
  AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then((value) => {
    // ... use value ...
  });
}
```
